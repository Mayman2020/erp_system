# Accounting Module — Complete Documentation

## A) BUSINESS OVERVIEW

### What the Accounting Module Does
The Accounting Module is the financial backbone of the CoreERP system. It provides full double-entry bookkeeping, financial reporting, bank reconciliation, and fiscal period management for organizations operating in bilingual (English/Arabic) environments.

### Who Uses It
- **Accountants** (role: ACCOUNTANT) — day-to-day journal entries, vouchers, reconciliation, ledger review, and report generation.
- **Administrators** (role: ADMIN) — full access plus accounting settings, fiscal year/period management, user/role management, and lookup configuration.

### Core Business Value
- Enforces double-entry accounting integrity at every level
- Provides real-time financial dashboards with KPIs
- Supports full journal lifecycle: Draft → Posted → Reversed
- Delivers Profit & Loss and Balance Sheet reports with date filtering
- Handles bank reconciliation workflow end-to-end
- Manages fiscal calendar with year/period open/close controls
- Bilingual (EN/AR) with RTL/LTR support

### Major Workflows
1. **Chart of Accounts Management** — Create, edit, activate/deactivate account tree
2. **Journal Entry Lifecycle** — Create draft → validate balance → post → optionally reverse
3. **Voucher Processing** — Payment/receipt vouchers with approve → post → cancel flow
4. **Transfer Management** — Inter-account transfers with posting
5. **Bank Reconciliation** — Statement vs system matching workflow
6. **Financial Reporting** — P&L by period, Balance Sheet as-of-date
7. **Ledger Inquiry** — Per-account transaction history with running balance
8. **Fiscal Administration** — Year/period creation, close/reopen

## C) BUSINESS FLOW DOCUMENTATION

### Chart of Accounts Management Flow
1. Admin creates root accounts (Assets, Liabilities, Equity, Revenue, Expenses)
2. Sub-accounts are created under parents with proper type inheritance
3. Opening balances are set with debit/credit side
4. Accounts can be deactivated (if not used in posted journals) and reactivated

### Journal Entry Lifecycle
1. **Create** → Entry saved as DRAFT with auto-generated reference number
2. **Validate** → System checks debit = credit balance
3. **Post** → Status changes to POSTED; fiscal period validated; timestamp recorded
4. **Reverse** → Creates a new POSTED entry with swapped debit/credit; original marked REVERSED
5. **Cancel** → Draft entries can be cancelled (terminal state)
6. **Delete** → Draft entries can be permanently deleted

### Voucher Processing Flow
1. **Draft** → Voucher created with amount, accounts, payment method
2. **Approve** → Manager approval recorded
3. **Post** → Journal entry auto-created; accounts debited/credited
4. **Cancel** → Cancellation with reason; reversal journal if posted

### Bank Reconciliation Flow
1. Select bank account and statement period
2. Enter statement opening/closing balances
3. System auto-loads journal lines for the linked GL account within the period
4. Match statement lines with system lines (full or partial matching)
5. Difference recalculated after each match/unmatch
6. Finalize when all statement lines matched and difference = 0
7. Cancel if reconciliation is abandoned

### Financial Reporting Flow
1. Select report type (P&L or Balance Sheet)
2. Choose date range or period preset
3. System aggregates posted + reversed journal entries
4. P&L: Revenue accounts (credit - debit) vs Expense accounts (debit - credit)
5. Balance Sheet: Opening balances + journal movements; synthetic "Current Period Earnings" line in equity
6. Accounting equation verified: Assets = Liabilities + Equity

### Ledger Inquiry Flow
1. Select an account from the chart of accounts
2. Optionally set date range
3. System calculates opening balance (signed opening + prior movements if date filtered)
4. Displays each journal line with running balance
5. Shows closing balance

## D) RULES & VALIDATIONS

### Accounting Rules
- **Double-entry enforcement:** Every journal entry must have total debit = total credit
- **Inactive account restriction:** Cannot post to inactive accounts
- **Minimum lines:** Every journal must have at least 2 lines

### Posting Rules
- Only DRAFT entries can be posted
- Posting date must fall within an open fiscal period
- Posted entries cannot be edited or deleted
- Posting sets timestamp and actor

### Reversal Rules
- Only POSTED entries can be reversed
- Reversal creates a new POSTED journal with swapped debit/credit amounts
- Original entry status changes to REVERSED with cross-reference to reversal
- Reversal preserves the net-zero effect on all account balances

### Reconciliation Rules
- Must pair a BANK_STATEMENT line with a SYSTEM_TRANSACTION line
- Cannot match lines that are already matched
- Partial matching supported (when amounts differ, matched amount = min of both)
- All statement lines must be matched before finalization
- Reconciliation difference must be zero before finalization
- Cannot modify a COMPLETED or CANCELLED reconciliation
- Difference is recalculated after every match/unmatch operation

### Date / Fiscal Rules
- Fiscal years have start/end dates
- Fiscal periods belong to a fiscal year
- Posting requires the entry date to fall within an open period
- Years and periods can be closed/reopened by authorized users
- Closing prevents further posting to that period

### Balance Constraints
- Opening balances must specify a side (DEBIT or CREDIT)
- Asset and Expense accounts have normal DEBIT balance
- Liability, Equity, and Income accounts have normal CREDIT balance
- Balance Sheet equation: Total Assets = Total Liabilities + Total Equity

## F) KNOWN RISKS / LIMITATIONS

### Honest Assessment

1. **Multi-currency support is declarative only:** The system stores `currencyCode` on journals and vouchers but does not perform exchange rate conversion or multi-currency balancing. All reports calculate in the stored amounts without currency normalization.

2. **Concurrent editing:** No optimistic locking (`@Version`) on journal entries or reconciliation. Two users editing the same draft journal simultaneously could overwrite each other's changes.

3. **Reconciliation partial matching:** While partial matching sets status to `PARTIALLY_MATCHED`, the remaining unmatched portion of a partially matched line cannot be matched to another line in the current implementation.

4. **Report performance at scale:** P&L and Balance Sheet load all journal entries for the period into memory. For large datasets (100K+ entries), this could cause performance issues. Consider adding database-level aggregation queries.

5. **Lookup type code alignment:** Some frontend lookup calls may use singular vs plural forms. A mismatch will result in empty filter dropdowns. This has been partially fixed but should be verified against the actual `lookup_types` table content.

6. **Dashboard language subscription:** The dashboard component subscribes to language changes without explicit unsubscription, which could cause a minor memory leak in single-page navigation scenarios.

7. **Fiscal period validation:** Posting is validated against fiscal periods, but if no fiscal periods are configured, the system allows posting to any date (fail-open). Consider whether fail-closed is more appropriate.

8. **Demo data in database:** Demo/seed data is now tagged with `is_demo_data = TRUE` via migration V26. For production deployment, these records should be deleted or the V17 migration should be excluded. The `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod` profile is supported but no automatic purge runs on prod startup.

9. **No audit trail for reconciliation:** Reconciliation match/unmatch/finalize actions are logged via `createdAt`/`updatedAt` timestamps but no detailed audit log captures who matched which lines and when.

10. **No export functionality:** Financial reports and ledger views do not have PDF/Excel export. The UI has no export buttons currently.
